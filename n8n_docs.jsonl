The documentation is live at docs.n8n.io. Previewing and building the documentation locally Prerequisites \u2219 Python 3.8 or above \u2219 Pip \u2219 n8n recommends using a virtual environment when working with Python, such as venv. \u2219 Follow the recommended configuration and auto-complete guidance for the theme. This will help when working with the mkdocs.yml file. \u2219 The repo includes a .editorconfig file. Make sure your local editor settings do not override these settings. In particular: o Don\u2019t allow your editor to replace tabs with spaces. This can affect our code samples (which must retain tabs for people building nodes). o One tab must be equivalent to four spaces. Steps For members of the n8n GitHub organization: 1. Set up an SSH token and add it to your GitHub account. Refer to GitHub | About SSH for guidance. 2. Then run these commands: git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:n8n-io/n8n-docs.git cd n8n-docs # Set up virtual environment if using one (steps depend on your system) # Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt pip install _submodules/insiders For external contributors: Rely on the preview builds on pull requests, or use the free version of Material for MkDocs (most things are the same, some formatting may be missing) Fork the repository, then: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/n8n-docs.git cd n8n-docs pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-material To serve a local preview: mkdocs serve Contributing Please read the CONTRIBUTING guide.

The n8n-nodes-module is an npm package that contains the node. Your custom node will get loaded automatically when n8n starts. Consider creating n8n-nodes-module if any of the following conditions satisfy your needs: - The nodes are only for yourself, your organization, or a small group of people. - The nodes require external dependencies that are not already available in n8n. NOTE: n8n-nodes-module can only be installed in self-hosted n8n instances. This functionality is currently not available on n8n Cloud or the desktop app. There are plans to introduce this functionality in the future. Prerequisites You may already be familiar with creating nodes in n8n. If you are unfamiliar with how to create n8n nodes, you can learn about it following the instructions mentioned in the Creating Your First Node tutorial. Install the following tools: \u2219 Git: You can find instructions on how to install Git here. \u2219 Node.js and npm: You can find instructions how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) here. The current minimum version is 14.15. In case you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can check the current version with the following command: bash node -v npm -v NOTE: Use node version 14.x and npm version 6.x. If using npm version 7+, you must enable legacy peer dependencies by setting: npm config set legacy-peer-deps true. [TODO: remove lerna per alex] \u2219 Lerna: You can install lerna globally with the following command: bash npm i \u2219 Install n8n: Create a new folder and install n8n using the command: npm install n8n Create custom n8n-nodes-module You can create multiple n8n-nodes-modules. Each individual n8n-nodes-module should get created in a separate folder since they are different npm packages. A single n8n-nodes-module can contain multiple nodes. If you\u2019re creating multiple nodes in the same module, as a best practice create each node in a separate folder. In this tutorial, you will create an n8n-nodes-module for the OpenWeatherMap API. You will name it n8n-nodes-weather. To quickly get started, clone the example starter using the following command: "}
{"text": "git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter.git n8n-nodes-weather. After the repo gets cloned, open the package.json file, and update the value of the name by replacing n8n-nodes-starter with n8n-nodes-weather. NOTE: The name of the module has to start with n8n-nodes-. Open the cloned repository in your code editor, and create a new folder called Weather, inside the nodes folder. Create Weather.node.ts file inside the Weather folder and paste the following code: import { IDataObject, IExecuteFunctions, INodeExecutionData, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription, IRequestOptions, NodeApiError, NodeOperationError, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export class Weather implements INodeType { description: INodeTypeDescription = { displayName: 'Weather', name: 'Weather', icon: 'fa:sun', group: ['input'], version: 1, description: 'Gets current and future weather information', defaults: { name: 'Weather', color: '#554455', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ { name: 'weatherApi', required: true, }, ], properties: [ { displayName: 'Operation', name: 'operation', type: 'options', options: [ { name: 'Current Weather', value: 'currentWeather', description: 'Returns the current weather data', }, { name: '5 day Forecast', value: '5DayForecast', description: 'Returns the weather data for the next 5 days', }, ], default: 'currentWeather', description: 'The operation to perform.', }, { displayName: 'Format', name: 'format', type: 'options', options: [ { name: 'Imperial', value: 'imperial', description: 'Fahrenheit | miles/hour', }, { name: 'Metric', value: 'metric', description: 'Celsius | meter/sec', }, { name: 'Scientific', value: 'standard', description: 'Kelvin | meter/sec', }, ], default: 'metric', description: 'The format in which format the data should be returned.', }, // ---------------------------------- // Location Information // ---------------------------------- { displayName: 'Location Selection', name: 'locationSelection', type: 'options', options: [ { name: 'City Name', value: 'cityName', }, { name: 'City ID', value: 'cityId', }, { name: 'Coordinates', value: 'coordinates', }, { name: 'Zip Code', value: 'zipCode', }, ], default: 'cityName', description: 'How to define the location for which to return the weather.', }, { displayName: 'City', name: 'cityName', type: 'string', default: '', placeholder: 'berlin,de', required: true, displayOptions: { show: { locationSelection: [ 'cityName', ], }, }, description: 'The name of the city to return the weather of.', }, { displayName: 'City ID', name: 'cityId', type: 'number', default: 160001123, required: true, displayOptions: { show: { locationSelection: [ 'cityId', ], }, }, description: 'The id of city to return the weather of.

{"text": "error) { if (this.continueOnFail()) { returnData.push({json:{ error: error.message }}); continue; } throw error; } } return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)]; } } The OpenWeatherMap API requires credentials to return results successfully. Create WeatherApi.credentials.ts file in the Credentials folder and paste the following code: import { ICredentialType, INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export class WeatherApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'weatherApi'; displayName = 'Weather API'; properties: INodeProperties[] = [ { displayName: 'Access Token', name: 'accessToken', type: 'string', default: '', }, ]; } Add the newly created node and the credential to the package.json file. Add \"dist/nodes/Weather/Weather.node.js\" to the nodes array in the n8n object (n8n.nodes). Similarly, add \"dist/credentials/WeatherApi.credentials.js\" to the credentials array in the n8n object (n8n.credentials). Develop and test the module Once you\u2019ve created the n8n-nodes-module, you need to build the code and publish the package locally to test it. Run the following commands: # Install dependencies npm install # Build the code npm run build # \"Publish\" the package locally npm link NOTE: If you get permission errors, run the command as a root user with sudo, for example sudo npm link. In the terminal, open the folder where you installed n8n. Run the following command to install the locally published module. # \"Install\" the above locally published module npm link n8n-nodes-weather Start n8n with the below command ./node_modules/n8n/bin/n8n start You will now be able to test and use your newly created n8n-nodes-module. Publish the n8n-nodes-module As mentioned, the n8n-nodes-module is an npm package. To make it available to others, you can publish it to the npm registry. Refer to the Publishing unscoped public packages guide to learn about publishing packages. Following the steps mentioned above, you can create multiple nodes within a single n8n-nodes module. You can also create nodes that require dependencies that are not present in n8n. When creating an n8n-nodes-module make sure that you follow the following guidelines: \u2219 The name of the module should start with n8n-nodes-. \u2219 The package.json file has to contain a key n8n with the paths to nodes and credentials. \u2219 The module has to be installed alongside n8n. Use the n8n-nodes-module in production Once you test and publish your n8n-nodes-module you would want to use it in your production environment. If you\u2019re running n8n via Docker, you will have to create a Docker image with the node module installed in n8n. Follow the steps below to create your Docker image: 1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from this Dockerfile. 2. Add the following command in your Dockerfile before the font installation command. RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-weather Your Dockerfile should look like this: FROM node:16-alpine ARG N8N_VERSION RUN if [ -z \"$N8N_VERSION\" ] ; then echo \"The N8N"}
{"text": "_VERSION argument is missing!\" ; exit 1; fi # Update everything and install needed dependencies RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec # Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root USER root # Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly. RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \\ npm config set python \"$(which python3)\" && \\ npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \\ apk del build-dependencies \\ && rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root; # Install your n8n-nodes-module. Replace <n8n-nodes-module> with the name of your module RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install <n8n-nodes module> # Install fonts RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \\ update-ms-fonts && \\ fc-cache -f && \\ apk del fonts && \\ find /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \\; \\ && rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu WORKDIR /data COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh ENTRYPOINT [\"tini\", \"--\", \"/docker-entrypoint.sh\"] EXPOSE 5678/tcp 3. Download the docker-entrypoint.sh file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile. 4. Build your Docker image: # Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number. # For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0 docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> -- tag=customizedn8n . You can now use your n8n-nodes-module in Docker. If you\u2019re running either by installing it globally or using PM2, make sure that you install your n8n-nodes-module inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically. archive-trigger-node.md Creating Your First Trigger Node This tutorial walks through building a trigger node. Prerequisites You need the following installed on your development machine: \u20138<\u2013 \u201c_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md\u201d You need some understanding of: \u2219 JavaScript/TypeScript \u2219 REST APIs \u2219 Webhooks \u2219 Expressions in n8n \u2219 git Build your node The first thing that we have to do is pick the service we want to create the node for. We will use Autopilot as an example. Since n8n\u2019s repository already has a Autopilot Trigger node, we will name this node Autofriend Trigger to avoid conflicts. Step 1: Set up the project \u20138<\u2013 \u201c_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/tutorial-set-up-project.md\u201d Creating the node 1. Go to packages/nodes-base/nodes. 2. Create a folder called Autofriend (the folder names are PascalCase). 3. Within the Autofriend folder, create a file called AutofriendTrigger.node.ts (YourNodeNameTrigger.node.ts). 4. Download and add the Autofriend icon to the folder. Name it autopilot.svg. o The icon property has to be either a 60x60 pixels PNG or an SVG and must exist in the node\u2019s folder. o An SVG is preferable. In case you have to use a PNG, make sure that it\u2019s compressed. A good tool for that\u2019s tinypng. o A good place "}
{"text": "to find company icons is gilbarbara/logos. 5. Paste the following code in the AutofriendTrigger.node.ts file. import { IDataObject, IHookFunctions, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription, IWebhookFunctions, IWebhookResponseData, } from 'n8n-workflow'; /* import { autofriendApiRequest, } from './GenericFunctions'; import { snakeCase, } from 'change-case'; */ export class AutofriendTrigger implements INodeType { description: INodeTypeDescription = { displayName: 'Autofriend Trigger', name: 'autofriendTrigger', icon: 'file:autofriend.svg', group: ['trigger'], version: 1, subtitle: '={{$parameter[\"event\"]}}', description: 'Handle Autofriend events using webhooks', defaults: { name: 'Autofriend Trigger', color: '#6ad7b9', }, inputs: [], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [], webhooks: [ { name: 'default', httpMethod: 'POST', responseMode: 'onReceived', path: 'webhook', }, ], properties: [], }; async webhook(this: IWebhookFunctions): Promise<IWebhookResponseData> { return { workflowData: [], }; } } Your directory structure should now look like the following. Autofriend\u2019s directory structure Autofriend\u2019s directory structure Adding the node to Editor UI n8n uses the properties set in the property description to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are displayName, name, color, icon, description, and subtitle. Check the following figure to see how the properties affect the looks of the node. Autofriend\u2019s appearance in Editor UI Autofriend\u2019s appearance in Editor UI Note: The property description conforms to INodeTypeDescription. Let\u2019s see how the node looks in the UI by following these steps: 1. Go to /packages/nodes-base/package.json. 2. Paste \"dist/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.js\", in the nodes array to register the node (in an alphabetical order). 3. Go to the project\u2019s main folder (n8n) in the terminal and run the following commands (it can take a few minutes). o The first command installs all dependencies of all the modules and links them together. o The second command builds all the code. o The third command starts n8n in development mode. lerna bootstrap --hoist npm run build npm run dev 4. Open your browser and go to localhost:8080 and you should be able to see the Editor UI. 5. Open the Create Node menu, select the Trigger tab, type Autofriend, and click on it to add the node to the Editor UI. Notes \u2219 On startup, n8n will load all the nodes and credentials (more about credentials later) that are registered in /packages/nodes-base/package.json. \u2219 The property description.name uses camelCase. \u2219 The property description.color is the company\u2019s branding color in hexadecimal. In case the website doesn\u2019tinclude this information, there are other websites that help you get a company\u2019s branding colors. For example, brandpalettes.com. Creating the UI for the node Double-clicking on the Autofriend Trigger node will open the Node Editor View. It will be empty since we haven\u2019t added any UI components yet. Luckily, n8n provides predefined JSON bas"}
{"text": "ed UI components that we can use to ask the user for different types of data. Autopilots\u2019s docs mention that to create a hook, we need to provide the following pieces of information: \u2219 event - Required \u2219 target_url - Required In the event parameter, we provide the name of the event for which we want to be notified. For example, contact_added. As the name implies, by providing contact_added as the event, we will be notified every time a contact is added to Autofriend. In the target_url parameter, we provide the URL where Autofriend will notify us when the event defined in the event parameter takes place. We don\u2019t need to ask the user for this parameter as n8n provides us with a method to obtain it. Adding the fields Let\u2019s make the Node Editor View ask for these parameters: 1. Add the following under description.properties in packages/nodes base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts.. { displayName: 'Event', name: 'event', type: 'options', required: true, default: '', options: [ { name: 'Contact Added', value: 'contactAdded', }, { name: 'Contact Added To List', value: 'contactAddedToList', }, { name: 'Contact Entered Segment', value: 'contactEnteredSegment', }, { name: 'Contact Left Segment', value: 'contactLeftSegment', }, { name: 'Contact Removed From List', value: 'contactRemovedFromList', }, { name: 'Contact Unsubscribed', value: 'contactUnsubscribed', }, { name: 'Contact Updated', value: 'contactUpdated', }, ], }, 2. Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. 3. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. npm run dev 4. Go to localhost:8080, refresh the page, and open the node again. The node should now look like in the following image. Autofriend\u2019s required fields Autofriend\u2019s required fields Creating the UI for credentials Most REST APIs use some sort of authentication mechanism. Autofriend\u2019s REST API uses API Keys. The API Key informs them about who is making the request to their system and gives you access to all the functionality that the API provides. Given all the things it can do, this has to be treated as a sensitive piece of information and should be kept private. n8n gives you the ability to ask for sensitive information using credentials. In the credentials, you can use all the generally available UI elements. Additionally, the data that\u2019s stored using the credentials would be encrypted before being saved to the database. In order to do that, n8n uses an encryption key. With that in mind, let\u2019s create the UI to ask for the user\u2019s Autofriend API Key. The process of creating and registering credentials is similar to that of creating and registering the node: 1. Go to packages/nodes-base/credentials. 2. Within the credentials folder, create a file named AutofriendApi.credentials.ts. 3. Paste the following code. import { ICredentialType, NodePropertyTypes, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export class AutofriendApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'autofriendApi'; displayName"}
{"text": " = 'Autofriend API'; properties = [ { displayName: 'API Key', name: 'apiKey', type: 'string' as NodePropertyTypes, default: '', }, ]; } 4. Go to /packages/nodes-base/package.json. 5. Paste \"dist/credentials/AutofriendApi.credentials.js\", in the credentials array to register the credentials (in an alphabetical order). 6. Got to packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts. 7. Associate the credentials with the node by adding the following to description.credentials. credentials: [ { name: 'autofriendApi', required: true, }, ], 8. Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. 9. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. npm run dev When you go to the Node Editor view, you should see the following. Autofriend\u2019s create credentials Autofriend\u2019s create credentials Autofriend\u2019s credentials Autofriend\u2019s credentials Understanding the life cycle for the webhook method When a Trigger node is executed either in test or production mode, the following happens: n8n persists all the webhooks defined in description.webhooks The persisted data will be used later to verify if the incoming requests to the n8n\u2019s webhook endpoint are valid. The property webhooks implements the interface IWebhookDescription. The interface has four properties. 1. name: The property name where n8n will look for the life cycle methods. 2. httpMethod: The HTTP method. 3. responseMode: When the trigger will respond. When developing a trigger node, this property must be set to onReceived. 4. path: The path added to the base URL. For example, for a Trigger node with the following webhooks property, n8n will create the following webhooks URLs. webhooks: [ { name: 'default', httpMethod: 'POST', responseMethod: 'onReceived', path: 'webhook', }, ] \u2219 Test: POST {{WEBHOOK_URL || localhost}}/webhook-test/{{uuid}}/{{path}} \u2219 Production: POST {{WEBHOOK_URL || localhost}}/webhook/{{uuid}}/{{path}} These URLs can be found in the node under the Webhook URLs label. These webhook URLs will be used as the notification URL (also known as the callback URL or target URL) when creating the webhook in the external system. Note: In test mode, the webhooks are persisted in memory. In production mode, they are persisted in the database. n8n executes the life cycle methods The life cycle methods allow us to create, delete, and check if the webhook exists in the external system. Methods \u2219 checkExist: This is the first method that gets called. It checks if the webhook with the current path is already registered in the external system or not. If the webhook is already registered, n8n persists the webhook ID. If the webhook isn\u2019t registered with the external system, the create method gets executed. \u2219 create: This method gets called if the checkExist method returns false (if the webhook with the current path doesn\u2019texist in the external system). This method registers the webhook in the external system and stores the webhook ID in n8n. \u2219 delet"}
{"text": "e: This method gets called when the trigger is either stopped manually or when the workflow is deactivated. It uses the ID previously persisted by either the create or the checkExist method to delete the webhook from the external system. Lifecycle flowchart Lifecycle flowchart Wait for new events to trigger the workflow Every time the external system notifies us about a change, by making an HTTP Request to the URL we previously registered in the create method, the execute method is called. Within this method, we have access to the request object and everything it contains. For example, body, headers, querystring, etc. The data the method returns is the data we want the rest of the workflow to have access to. Let\u2019s see how this would look for our current use-case: 1. Go to packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend, create a file named GenericFunctions.ts, and paste the following code. import { IDataObject, IExecuteFunctions, IHookFunctions, ILoadOptionsFunctions, IRequestOptions, IWebhookFunctions, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export async function autofriendApiRequest(this: IExecuteFunctions | IWebhookFunctions | IHookFunctions | ILoadOptionsFunctions, method: string, resource: string, body: any = {}, query: IDataObject = {}, uri?: string, option: IDataObject = {}): Promise<any> { // tslint:disable-line:no-any const credentials = await this.getCredentials('autofriendApi') as IDataObject; const apiKey = credentials.apiKey; const endpoint = 'https://api2.autopilothq.com/v1'; const options: IRequestOptions = { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', autopilotapikey: apiKey, }, method, body, qs: query, uri: uri || `${endpoint}${resource}`, json: true, }; if (!Object.keys(body).length) { delete options.body; } if (!Object.keys(query).length) { delete options.qs; } try { return await this.helpers.request!(options); } catch (error) { if (error.response) { const errorMessage = error.response.body.message || error.response.body.description || error.message; throw new Error(`Autopilot error response [${error.statusCode}]: ${errorMessage}`); } throw error; } } 2.

Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal where you are running n8n. 6. Run the project using a tunnel by entering ./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel in the terminal. Access the n8n Editor UI at localhost:5678. 7. Enter the API key in the credentials. Instructions to find the API Key can be found here. 8. Go to the workflow editor, save your workflow, and execute the node. Executed node Executed node 9. Log into Autopilot and update a contact. Keep in mind that this should be done within two minutes after you executed the node. After that time frame, the webhook will be unregistered automatically and you will not be able to receive the event. If it takes you longer than that, please execute the node and update the contact again. Executed node with results Executed node with results The trigger node is now receiving events. Sometimes it might take a bit longer for the payload to arrive. You probably noticed that this time we did not run the project using npm run dev, but instead using ./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel. Since our server is running locally, we need a tool that lets us proxy all requests to our local machine so that n8n receives and handles the events from the external service (Autopilot). This gets achieved using a tunnel. The details on how a tunnel works are out of the scope of this tutorial. If you want to know about it, you can check this link. Keep in mind that the tunnel is meant for development purposes only and shouldn\u2019t be used in production.

{"text": "lf but maybe less for data like parameters. The reason why it is also needed, is that they may contain an expression. Expressions get always executed of the context for an item. If that would not be the case, for example, the Email Send node not would be able to send multiple emails at once to different people. Instead, the same person would receive multiple emails. The index is 0 based. So $item(0) will return the first item, $item(1) the second one, and so on. By default the item of the last run of the node will be returned. So if the referenced node ran 3x (its last runIndex is 2) and the current node runs the first time (its runIndex is 0) the data of runIndex 2 of the referenced node will be returned. For more information about what data can be accessed via $node, check out the Variable: $node section. Example: // Returns the value of the JSON data property \"myNumber\" of Node \"Set\" (first item) const myNumber = $item(0).$node[\"Set\"].json[\"myNumber\"]; // Like above but data of the 6th item const myNumber = $item(5).$node[\"Set\"].json[\"myNumber\"]; // Returns the value of the parameter \"channel\" of Node \"Slack\". // If it contains an expression the value will be resolved with the // data of the first item. const channel = $item(0).$node[\"Slack\"].parameter[\"channel\"]; // Like above but resolved with the value of the 10th item. const channel = $item(9).$node[\"Slack\"].parameter[\"channel\"]; archive8n-nodes-base.cron.md Cron The Cron node is useful to schedule the workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals. This works in a similar way to the cron software utility in Unix-like systems. This core node is a Trigger node. /// note | Keep in mind 1. If a workflow is using the Cron node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow. /// 2. Make sure that the timezone is set correctly for the n8n instance (or the workflow). Node Reference You can configure the node by clicking on the Add Cron Time button under the Trigger Times section. There are a couple of different options available for the Mode field in the form of a dropdownlist. \u2219 Mode o Every Minute o Every Hour o Every Day o Every Week o Every Month o Every X o Custom The \u2018Every X\u2019 option allows you to specify the workflow to be triggered every x minutes or hours. You can specify x by entering a number in the Value field. The \u2018Custom\u2019 option allows you to enter a custom cron expression in the Cron Expression field. FAQs How to generate a custom Cron expression? To generate a Cron expression, you can use crontab guru. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the Cron Expression field in n8n. Why there are six asterisks (*) in the Cron Expression? The sixth asterisk in the Cron Expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional.

{"text": " for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows. Node Reference You can also use the methods and variables mentioned in the Expressions page in the Function Item node. Variable: item It contains the \u201cjson\u201d data of the currently processed item. The data can be accessed and manipulated like this: // Uses the data of an already existing key to create a new additional one item.newIncrementedCounter = item.existingCounter + 1; return item; Method: getBinaryData() Returns all the binary data (all keys) of the item which gets currently processed. item.filename = getBinaryData().attachment_0.fileName; return item; Method: setBinaryData(binaryData) Sets all the binary data (all keys) of the item which gets currently processed. Method: getWorkflowStaticData(type) This gives access to the static workflow data. It is possible to save data directly with the workflow. This data should, however, be very small. A common use case is to for example to save a timestamp of the last item that got processed from an RSS-Feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n will check automatically if the data has changed and will save it, if necessary. There are two types of static data. The \u201cglobal\u201d and the \u201cnode\u201d one. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. And every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data, however, is different for every node and only the node which set it can retrieve it again. Note: The static data cannot be read and written when executing via manual executions. The data will always be empty, and the changes will not persist. The static data will only be saved when a workflow is active. Example // Get the global workflow static data const staticData = getWorkflowStaticData('global'); // Get the static data of the node const staticData = getWorkflowStaticData('node'); // Access its data const lastExecution = staticData.lastExecution; // Update its data staticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime(); // Delete data delete staticData.lastExecution; External libraries You can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Function Item node.

For example, for internal systems or something very specific to your internal tooling. Also, the CLI only works if there are no additional dependencies required by the node as it does not support installing additional node modules. If that is not the case, it is best to do follow the creating your first node tutorial or create your own custom node-package. Create the first basic node 1. Install the n8n-node-dev CLI: npm install -g n8n-node-dev 2. Create and go into the newly created folder in which you want to keep the code of the node 3.

Development If you\u2019re creating a node requested by a community member, make sure to comment on the feature request in the community forum{:target=_blank .external-link}. Add complementary operations to each resource (for example, create, delete) Programmatic-style only. Check the node works with more than one input item. Ensure the parameters have the correct type. Mind the defaults: if the service has a default as true, keep it as true. Changing default values can break the existing workflows of the users. Check if the node disposes of everything. In particular, the node has closed all connections. Check your code using the node linter. Testing Test \u201ccreate\u201d and \u201cupdate\u201d operations with all fields/operations. Test the continueOnFail option with a Function node. For example, a Widget node has a GET operation that takes a widgetId and returns information on the widget. To test that the workflow continues on fail, set the Widget node to continue on fail, create a Function node, return a valid and an invalid widgetId, connect the Function node to Widget node, and run the workflow. The Widget node should show two items: one with information on the widget and another one with the error from having passed an invalid ID.)

PR #4295{:target=_blank .external link}, PR #6209{:target=_blank .external link} Execution order n8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows: In multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first. n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute. Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in workflow settings.

PR #6189{:target=_blank .external link} EXECUTIONS_PROCESS and \u201cown\u201d mode Previously, you could use the EXECUTIONS_PROCESS environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the main process or in their own processes. This option and own mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, main will be the new default. Note that executions start much faster in main mode than in own mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure queue mode to distribute executions among multiple workers.

They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available. AI chain AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don\u2019t use persistent memory, so you can\u2019t use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this). AI embedding Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They\u2019re used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings. AI memory In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can\u2019t. AI tool In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks. AI vector store Vector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings. API APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service\u2019s data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems.

After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service. data pinning (n8n) Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution. editor (n8n) The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more. entitlement (n8n) In n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time. Floating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance. evaluation (n8n) In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows. expression (n8n) In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment. LangChain LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications. Large language model (LLM) Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They\u2019re built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data. node (n8n) In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services. project (n8n) n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources. root node (n8n) Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster.

Each metric from the summary banner is also clickable, taking you to the corresponding chart. The insights dashboard also has a table showing individual insights from each workflow including total production executions, failed production executions, failure rate, time saved, and run time average. Insights time periods By default, the insights summary banner and dashboard show a rolling 7 day window with a comparison to the previous period to identify increases or decreases for each metric. On the dashboard, paid plans also display data for other date ranges: \u2219 Pro: 7 and 14 days \u2219 Enterprise: 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year Setting the time saved by a workflow For each workflow, you can set the number of minutes of work a workflow saves you each time it runs. You can configure this by navigating to the workflow, selecting the three dots menu in the top right and selecting settings. There you can update the Estimated time saved value and save. This setting helps you calculate how much time automating a process saves over time vs the manual effort to complete the same task or process. Once set, n8n calculates the amount of time the workflow saves you based on the number of production executions and displays it on the summary banner and dashboard. Disable or configure insights metrics collection If you self-host n8n, you can disable or configure insights and metrics collection using environment variables. Insights FAQs Which executions do n8n use to calculate the values in the insights banner and dashboard? n8n insights only collects data from production executions (for example, those from active workflows triggered on a schedule or a webhook) from the main (parent) workflow. This means that it doesn\u2019t count manual (test) executions or executions from sub-workflows or error workflows. Does n8n use historic execution data when upgrading to a version with insights? n8n only starts collecting data for insights once you update to the first supported version (1.89.0). This means it only reports on executions from that point forward and you won\u2019t see execution data in insights from prior periods. docs-shortcuts.md Keyboard shortcuts and controls n8n provides keyboard shortcuts for some actions.

Release date: 2025-05-19 This release contains editor improvements, an API update, node updates, new nodes, and bug fixes. Verified community nodes on Cloud We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve expanded the n8n ecosystem and unlocked a new level of flexibility for all users including those on n8n Cloud! Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in. This update focuses on three major improvements: \u2219 Cloud availability: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud. \u2219 Built-in discovery: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm. \u2219 Trust and verification: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout. This is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus. Learn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our blog post. \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00bb Use a verified node Make sure you\u2019re on n8n version 1.94.0 or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to documentation. In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default. \u2219 Open the Nodes panel from the editor \u2219 Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield \u00f0\u0178\u203a\u00a1\u00ef\u00b8\u0081 \u2219 Select the node and click Install Once an Owner installs a"}

{"text": "tial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity.
